# Fly_me_to_the_moon


The basic objective of this game is to send a rocket through the universe from Earth to Mars.

Every time a rocket is launched, it will pass through the moon, which changes position at random. The rocket will thereafter be affected by the gravitational field, which has a radius five times greater than the moon and changes the trajectory of the rocket. Remember that the force is inversely proportional to the distance between the rocket and the moon, so it will increase as the rocket gets closer to the moon, and vice versa. By taking this idea into account, users will be able to change the rocket's launch angle and initial velocity. However, don't worry! It's just a simple game, and you don't need to think about all the complicated math equations!
