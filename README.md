# Fly_me_to_the_moon

The main purpose of this game is to launch a rocket from the Earth to Mars across the universe. 

Each time a rocket is launched, it will travel through the moon's gravitational field, which has a radius five times that of the moon. This will cause the trajectory of the rocket to change. The beginning velocity and the angle of the rocket can be altered by the user.
